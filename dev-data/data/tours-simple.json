    "description": "Fernway has come up with a variety of West Bengal tours, covering various aspects of one of India's culturally richest states. Be it local traditions like the celebration of Durga Pooja or colonial legacy in the form of memorials, Kolkata, the state capital, displays it with pride. Go on a boat ride or wildlife safari with our West Bengal packages in the vast mangrove forest, called Sundarbans, where you can spot tigers, dolphins and saltwater crocodiles. Similarly, you may spot an endangered one-horned rhino in the Dooars grasslands. One of the best places to beat the summer heat or spend a honeymoon during West Bengal holidays is Darjeeling. Take the famous toy train, tour a tea estate, go rafting in the Rangeet or Teesta River or explore the hordes of trekking trails through the mountains. Staying at a plush hotel or a comfortable lodge, overlooking Mount Kanchenjunga, will surely relieve you all stress.",
