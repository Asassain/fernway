Go on a boat ride or wildlife safari with our West Bengal packages in the vast mangrove forest, called Sundarbans, where you can spot tigers, dolphins and saltwater crocodiles. Similarly, you may spot an endangered one-horned rhino in the Dooars grasslands. One of the best places to beat the summer heat or spend a honeymoon during West Bengal holidays is Darjeeling. Take the famous toy train, tour a tea estate, go rafting in the Rangeet or Teesta River or explore the hordes of trekking trails through the mountains. Staying at a plush hotel or a comfortable lodge, overlooking Mount Kanchenjunga, will surely relieve you all stress.",

    "description": "Mysore city was the capital of the old royal Mysore province. The word Mysore expands to Mahishasurana Ooru which means the town of Mahishasura. The story goes that the demon Mahishasura was killed by goddess Chamundeshwari atop the Chamundi hill near Mysore, hence the name. Ever since, the Mysore royal family has worshipped Chamundeshwari as the palace deity. Hills dedicated to her stand at the eastern end of Mysore town today.The Wodeyar family ruled Mysore since 14th century except for a short period of 40 years when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were the rulers. Mysore has never failed to mesmerize the tourists with its quaint charm, rich heritage, magnificent palaces, beautifully laid-out gardens, imposing buildings, broad shady avenues and sacred temples. The charm of this city leaves no one untouched.",
